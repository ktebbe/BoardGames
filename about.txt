Look, I play a lot of games. And I love them. But just like music, or movies, or any other form of entertainment, no one game is perfect for every situation. Sometimes you want a party game that's easy to pick up and highly interactive. Other times, you want a new obsession for your inner circle of fellow game geeks and don't mind if it takes 2+ hours to play (let alone 45 minutes to learn). <b>This game recommender was built with that in mind!</b> <br> <br>I rated most of the games that I've played on five characteristics that differentiate games in meaningful ways. Choose the traits that matter to you, slide the scale to indicate what you want that trait to be, and watch the <i>magic</i> happen (okay, fine, it just calculates Euclidian distance, get off my back).
